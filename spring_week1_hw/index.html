        <p>The data I will collect would be how many water I drink everyday, like a way to stimulate myself to drink more water. I will use a water level sensor to detect how many water would be left during a period of time
        <br>
        the data collection method (physically): everytime I drink some water, I will pour some water out of the glass to maintain the same water level with the cup I used to drink.
        </p>
        <p>How often will you measure and how often will you record the values?</p>
        <p>The sensor will be put inside a cup for one afternoon (or a period of time as long as much data has been collected</p>
        <p>Will you record all the values or only the changes?</p>
        <p>All the values will be collected and will be presented in a sequence so that a pattern can be found</p>
        <p>When will the translation of raw values into meaningful data take place - before or after the recording?</p>
        <p>After the recording. So that a reflection and a retrospect on the performance of my drinking habit can be summarized</p>
