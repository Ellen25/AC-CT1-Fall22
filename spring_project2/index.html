        <a >PROJECT 2 DOCUMENTATION:</a>
        <a>1. Inspiration & Idea</a>
        <br>
        <p>I'm constantly thinking about the definition of future past. I think the future is essentially a response to the past, and the future is essentially a transient state viewed from the perspective of the present. The concept of time can be blurred, so I hope to establish some connection with the past through the imagination of the future.</p>
        <p>If the apocalypse does come and overthrow all existing institutions, will humanity draw inspiration from past experience and recreate a new order? How far back can such a past go? Will what we are experiencing now become a kind of past? Therefore, I believe that first of all, religion as a carrier of belief with a long history and a relatively stable group of fans can be reproduced. What about the Internet? Will this new thing, which has risen and become strong in the 21st century, remain in the memory of some people and be translated into reality?</p>
        <p>Therefore, I want to build a new belief system with a strong belief in the Internet and the market mechanism it extends.</p>
