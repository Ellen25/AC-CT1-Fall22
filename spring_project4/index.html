        <a>1. Background Story</a>
        <br>
        <p>You live in a town in ruins, where people believe in virtual objects to a degree that outsiders cannot fathom. From the outside, it looks like an arcadia, but only you know that everything here has been whitewashed by this empty belief. People are obsessed with worshiping, collecting, and trading virtual beliefs in exchange for the meager alms of others. The superior divided the statues into three classes and regularly recycled them. Unbeknownst to them, they took them out into the world and sold them for millions.</p>

        <a>2. Game Concept</a>
        <p>You are trying to explore the mechanism of this rottened society. By following the rule, you need to collect the statues and send them to the endpoint. The score, or say, the value that your collections can be counted depends on the value of each statue, which is random.</p>

        <a>4. Playing the game</a>

        <a>5. Comments & Next</a>    
        <p>I received several comments for the game mechanics. The design and the logic behind the experience was unclear since not much instructions can be found. Also, the design of the button was a bit farfetched. I would keep adding mechanisms to the current version. For instance, letting the statues following the controller after it has been selected can be one possibility. And I will also keep completing the storytelling part so that it can be more sophisticated</p>
