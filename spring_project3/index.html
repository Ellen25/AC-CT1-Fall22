        <a>1. Inspiration & Idea</a>
        <br>
        <p>[I felt at last that all our correspondence had been a great illusion, that each of us was only writing to ourselves.]<br> -Andr√© Gide</p>
        <br>
        <p>My dreamed space would be an infinit mirror space. In my dream world, the most authentic communication between people can be established anywhere, anytime: anyone you want to see, hug or kiss, you can see immediately. Thus, the protagonist of such a world is anyone himself, and the mirror is the medium through which all connections are made.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Such world-building, however, is tinged with pessimism. The sense of touch and emotion that seem intimate may be illusory. The creation and communication of emotions, as depicted by Andre Gide, may be no more than a great illusion. The message conveyed through the mirror may be true at one moment, but in the long course of history, it is only an illusion in the mirror.</p>
        <br>
        <p>At the same time, this false connection can also be understood as a momentary reality. Existentialism holds that existence precedes essence. People exist first, and then define themselves through their own choices, and find their essence for themselves. In the infinite mirror world, people get real touch by touching the mirror, whose essence is an infinite extension of self. Along with this interactive process, new selves are constantly being constructed and influencing future selves. Thus, an illusory connection brings absolute reality.</p>
